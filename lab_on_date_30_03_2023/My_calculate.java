//You are given a class AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method 
//signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write another class called MyCalculator 
//which implements the method.
//divisorSum method just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. 
//For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12. 
//The value of n will be at most 1000.
//Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. 
//You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public.
